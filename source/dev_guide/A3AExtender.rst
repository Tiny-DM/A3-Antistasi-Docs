How to Extend Antistasi?
==================================

.. card::
   :class-card: sd-card-2 sd-mt-3

   With the convertion to a mod Antistasi has added a lot of support for 3rd party mods to add to or alter its behaviour, this includes **adding** and **overwriting** **Templates** and **Maps**
   in the provided example on `Github <https://github.com/official-antistasi-community/A3AExtender>`_ we have a example of doing just that, along with all the tools and steps to fully make your own mod to extend Antistasi

   Once you have made your own mod with the additions or changes you wanted, simply load it alongside Antistasi the mod and voila you have succesfully added/changed a template/map to Antistasi.

   An example Code for extending the Antistasi-mod can be found on `Github <https://github.com/official-antistasi-community/A3AExtender>`_.

Important things to modify
==================================

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2-light

   Important things to modify
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

   - Under addons/core/Includes you need to adapt :code:`script_mod.hpp` to have a unique :code:`PREFIX` and :code:`MODFOLDER`.
   - Under all addons **EXCEPT** core you need to update :code:`script_component.hpp` to have updateded path to match the :code:`MODFOLDER` define in :code:`script_mod.hpp`.

   .. rst-class:: code-block-2
   .. code-block:: guess

      #include "\x\${MODFOLDER}\addons\core\Includes\script_mod.hpp"

   .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

   -  | Next you need to update all :code:`$PBOPREFIX$` with the new path :code:`x\${MODFOLDER}\addons\${COMPONENT}`.
      | All ${Something} should be replaced with their corresponding elements.

   .. dropdown:: Example
      :class-title: header-3-light
      :class-container: sd-card-3

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

      If MODFOLDER is :code:`A3AE` you would replace all ${MODFOLDER} with A3AE.

      .. rst-class:: code-block-3
      .. code-block:: guess

         #include "\x\A3AE\addons\core\Includes\script_mod.hpp"

Example additions
==================================

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2-light

   Example additions
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   .. card::
      :class-header: header-3-light
      :class-card: sd-card-3

      Maps
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

      | Antistasi now supports 3rd party map porting.
      | There are two examples added for working with maps. Adding a new map and overwriting/applying additions for an existing map.
      | In this examples there are also demonstrations of mission specific overwrites of :code:`mapInfo` and :code:`navGrid` data as well as global overwrite/addition.
      | You will find all the information regarding this under :code:`A3AE/addons/maps`.
      | Take care to study all the files in the addon to not miss crucial porting steps.

   .. card::
      :class-header: header-3-light
      :class-card: sd-card-3

      Templates
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

      | Antistasi now supports 3rd party template additions/overwrites.
      | To add new templates or overwrite existing ones follow the demonstration given in :code:`A3AE/addons/templates/Templates/Templates.hpp`.
      | Note that while you can add addon vehicle templates to Antistasi at this time, it should be noted that it is still a limited system and you shouldn't expect full functionality from them atm.
      | Again it's important to read through all the files in the :code:`templates` addon to not miss important steps.

Event-System
==================================

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2-light

   Mod integrated event system
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Antistasi’s functionality is extendable by 3rd party mods through the events system, where you can subscribe to events whitin antistasi like for example vehicle initilisation.

   .. rst-class:: code-paragraph-2

   A record of the events and their arguments can be found in the config under :code:`A3A >> Events` where the class name is the event name and the sub class params contains a list of the arguments in order of argument index, each element of this list contains a :code:`description`, a list of valid :code:`types` (array, string, number, `…`) and a flag for if it is :code:`optional` (not guarented to be passed along). In addition to this class of arguments is a flag for the execution location of the event (:code:`isLocal`, 1 = local, 0 = global)

   .. dropdown:: Subscribe to an Event
      :class-container: sd-card-3
      :class-title: header-3-light

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

      To subscribe to an event you use the :code:`A3A_Events_fnc_addEventListener`.

      .. rst-class:: code-block-3
      .. code-block:: guess

         /**
         Description:
             Add a listener to an event, allowing you to trigger functions when that event occurs

         Arguments:
         0. <String> Event identifier, as registered in configFile >> A3A >> Events
         1. <String> Unique identifier of listener
         2. <String|Code> Code block or name of function to excecute on event occurance

         Return Value:
         <Array<Event, ID>> data needed to remove listener

         Scope: Any
         Environment: unscheduled
         Public: Yes
         Dependencies:

         Example:
         */

         ["AIVehInit", "A3A_Events_example", "someFuncName"] call A3A_Events_fnc_addEventListener;
         ["AIVehInit", "A3A_Events_example", {systemChat "Example event listener triggered!"}] call A3A_Events_fnc_addEventListener;
         ["AIVehInit", "A3A_Events_example", someFunc] call A3A_Events_fnc_addEventListener;

   .. dropdown:: Unsubscribe an Event
      :class-container: sd-card-3
      :class-title: header-3-light

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

      To remove an event listener use the :code:`A3A_Events_fnc_removeEventListener` function.

      .. rst-class:: code-block-3
      .. code-block:: guess

         /**
         Description:
             Removes a event listener

         Arguments:
         0. <String> Event the listener is subscribed to
         1. <String> The event listeners unique identifier

         Return Value:
         <Nil|Array> Nil if failed, deleted event listener otherwise

         Scope: Any
         Environment: unscheduled
         Public: Yes
         Dependencies:
         */

         Example: ["AIVehInit", "A3A_Events_example"] call A3A_Events_fnc_removeEventListener;

   .. dropdown:: Unsubscribe all Events
      :class-container: sd-card-3
      :class-title: header-3-light

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

      To remove all event listener of a type use the :code:`A3A_events_fnc_removeAllEventListeners` function.

      .. rst-class:: code-block-3
      .. code-block:: guess

         /**
         Description:
             Removes all event listeners subscribed to a particular event

         Arguments:
         0. <String> Event to remove listeners from

         Return Value: <Nil|Array> Nil if failed, the removed listeners otherwise

         Scope: Any
         Environment: unscheduled
         Public: Yes
         Dependencies:
         */

         Example: ["AIVehInit"] call A3A_Events_fnc_removeAllEventListeners;

Building the mod
==================================

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2-light

   Building the mod
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

   | To build the mod you first need to navigate to :code:`Tools\Builder` and edit :code:`buildAddons.ps1`.
   | On line 6 replace :code:`$addonName = "A3AE"` with :code:`$addonName = "${your addons main folder name}"`, so if you name your extension A3A-AltisRemade then the line would be :code:`$addonName = "A3A-AltisRemade"`, save the file and close it.
   | Now all you need to do is run the script and it will build the mod for you (note: it will not sign it for you, this needs to be done manually before publishing with :code:`Arma 3 Tools` -> :code:`DSUtils` & :code:`Publisher`).
